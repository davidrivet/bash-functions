# bash-functions

Some bash functions to make some recurrent terminal interactions simpler/faster.

# Usage

Clone the repository, modify bash.myfunctions.sh setting the variable PATH_TO_FILES with the actual full path to the cloned directory.

Then add the following line to your .bashrc file. Run bash or start a new terminal to use the functions.

All this can be performed manually or by running the following command just after having cloned the repo.

```bash
cd bash-functions && sed -i "s/^PATH_TO_FILES=.*/PATH_TO_FILES=$(pwd | sed 's/\//\\\//g')/g" bash.myfunctions.sh && echo "source $(pwd)/bash.myfunctions.sh" >> ~/.bashrc && cd ..
```
